# 🛡️ SheSafe – Smart Safety Companion for Women

SheSafe is a mobile-first safety app designed to support women in high-risk or unsafe environments. The platform enables users to trigger emergency alerts, share live locations, and discreetly notify trusted contacts — all with a single gesture or voice command.

This GitHub repository includes the front-end design and planned features for the SheSafe platform. It is a work in progress intended to demonstrate the core concept and support my research proposal in the domain of gender safety, tech-based interventions, and public health.

## 🔹 Project Goals

Women across the world — especially migrants, students, and low-income workers — face daily risks related to gender-based violence, harassment, and unsafe travel. In many cases:

- There is no way to discreetly request help
- Internet access is limited during emergencies
- Public spaces lack smart surveillance or aid triggers

SheSafe aims to build a platform that provides:

- Silent, fast alerting
- Automatic location + media sharing
- Offline fallback safety triggers
- Integration with local safety databases and emergency numbers

---

## 🔹 Key Features (Planned)

- 🆘 One-Tap Emergency Alert to Trusted Contacts
- 📍 Real-Time Location Tracking
- 📸 Auto-capture Audio/Photo Evidence on Trigger
- 🎙️ Voice-activated or Motion-based Triggers
- 🔒 Privacy-First Data Handling
- 🚨 Integration with National Helplines and Police APIs
- 📶 Works in Low-Connectivity Areas (via SMS fallback)

---

## 🔹 Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (MVP) → Flutter (planned mobile app)
- Backend (planned): Firebase, Twilio, AWS SNS
- APIs:
  - Google Maps API (for location)
  - Twilio API (SMS fallback)
  - OpenAI (for voice/speech recognition prototype)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (MVP), Firebase Hosting (later)

---

## 🔹 Current Progress

- ✅ UI prototype for emergency screen (HTML/CSS)
- ✅ Layout of features and mockup buttons
- ⏳ JavaScript logic for alerting and location
- 🟡 Voice activation, SMS fallback (next phase)
- 🚀 Plan to develop full mobile version in Flutter
